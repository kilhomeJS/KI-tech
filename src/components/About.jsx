                My journey in this field began a few years ago when I worked as
                a C# developer and became fascinated with process optimization
                using Selenium.

                However, everything changed when I encountered a problem with a
                friend who was running a small online store. He was spending too
                much time manually setting up marketing funnels, newsletters,
                and analytics. That’s when I realized I could help him save time
                and make his business more efficient by creating automation
                solutions.

                I started learning marketing automation tools like Zapier,
                Make.com, HubSpot, and others. With each new project, I honed my
                skills and discovered faster and more effective ways to solve
                problems. Since then, I have been working directly with various
                companies, helping them optimize their marketing processes,
                increase conversions, and reduce costs.

                Now, I’m expanding and looking for new clients to work with,
                because once everything that can be automated is taken care of,
                it’s time to find new opportunities.

                My goal is to help businesses focus on what matters most by
                leaving all the automation to me. I communicate effectively with
                clients, and I don’t need complex technical specifications: with
                my extensive experience, I can turn your ideas into reality
                without unnecessary details and delays.
